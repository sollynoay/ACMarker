# ACMarker
An acoustic camera simulator to generate synthetic images. Theoretically, the simulator can generate general acoustic images. However, it is specially to generate acoustic camera-based fiducial markers here.

## How to install
This program currently works under Blender 2.80. Python script is used to generate images. After installing some dependencies to the python in Blender, it can be implemented.

## Dependencies
- OpenEXR 1.3.2
- Opencv 3.4.8 

## Saving path
Don't forget to change the saving path in the program. Acoustic images are generated from gray-scale images and depth images. Such images are temporally saved in your PC and read to generate acoustic image. Open Toggle System Console to check if the names of the saved images are correct.
